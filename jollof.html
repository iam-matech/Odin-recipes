        <h1>My Jollof Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../Odin-recipes/images/jollof-rice-recipe-23.jpg">
        <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa’s most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>

                <li>
                    1/4 cup chopped green onion for garnish (optional)

                </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>
            After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.   
        </p>
        <p><h5><em>Cook's Note:</em></h5></p>
        <p>
            If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again.
